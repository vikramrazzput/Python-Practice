"""
Data type specifies the type of value a variable holds. This is required in programming to do various 
operations without causing an error.
In python, we can print the type of any operator using type function:

"""

# Sequenced data: list, tuple

# list: A list is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within square brackets. 
# Lists are mutable and can be modified after creation.
list1 = [8, 2.3, [-4, 5], ["apple", "banana"]];
print(list1);

# Tuple: A tuple is an ordered collection of data with elements separated by a comma and enclosed within parentheses. 
# Tuples are immutable and can not be modified after creation.
tuple1 = (("parrot", "sparrow"), ("Lion", "Tiger"));
print(tuple1);

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#  Mapped data: dict

# dict: A dictionary is an unordered collection of data containing a key:value pair. 
# The key:value pairs are enclosed within curly brackets.
dict1 = {"name":"Sakshi", "age":20, "canVote":True};
print(dict1);
