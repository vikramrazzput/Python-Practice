Data type specifies the type of value a variable holds. This is required in programming to do various 
operations without causing an error.
In python, we can print the type of any operator using type function:

"""


print("The type of a is ", type(a)); # <class 'int'>

print("The type of b is ", type(b)); # <class 'bool'>

print("The type of c is ", type(c)); # <class 'str'>

print("The type of d is ", type(d)); # <class 'NoneType'>
